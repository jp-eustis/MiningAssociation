I chose an Indian Airline Ticket Price dataset because it was a very nominal dataset for the most part making it easy to edit so Apriori could run.

Apriori found four rules all with at least 90% confidence. If it is an Indigo airline flight the class will be economy.(Confidence 100%) If it is an Indigo airline flight it will have one stop.(Confidence 100%)
If it is a Vistara flight and has one stop it is an economy class flight.(Confidence 90%) Lastly, if it is a buisness class flight it will have one stop.(Confidence 90%)

The most suprising rule to me is that all Vistara Business class flights have one stop. That seemed kind of odd especially for business class. The least suprising was that Indigos Economy class flights all had one stop. 


Best rules found:
